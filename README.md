## Description

Project 3 is an application that can be used to see events happpening in your  area. Users can add events to a map that will then be seen by other users of the application. The users can then save those events to their profile so they will be able to attend later. We believe this application would be extremely useful for creating and finding local events that could otherwise have gone unnoticed.
